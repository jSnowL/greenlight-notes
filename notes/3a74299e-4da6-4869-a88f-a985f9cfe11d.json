It is only declared within the for loop statement. printNumTwo() ***returned the correct value because three different i variables with unique values (0, 1, and 2) were created by the let keyword within the loop statement.*** ????","id":"3a74299e-4da6-4869-a88f-a985f9cfe11d","date":"2018-11-27T18:49:57.711Z"}
